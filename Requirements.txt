2. Functional Requirements 
1. User Registration & Authentication 
1.1. Users shall be able to create an account by providing a username, email, and secure 
password. 
1.2. Users shall be able to log in using their registered credentials. 
1.3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) shall be implemented for enhanced security. 
1.4. Password reset functionality shall be available through email verification. 
2. Email Composition & Encryption 
2.1. Users shall be able to compose email messages (encrypted using AES-256) within the 
system. 
2.2. The encryption key shall be securely transmitted using RSA-2048 encryption. 
3. Encrypted Email Storage & Retrieval 
3.1. All emails shall be stored in encrypted form in the database. 
3.2. Only authorized users shall be able to retrieve and decrypt their received emails. 
3.3. The system shall ensure that even if the database is compromised, the emails remain 
unreadable without the decryption key. 
4. User Interface & Access Control 
4.1. The user interface shall allow users to compose, send, and view encrypted emails. 
4.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) shall be implemented by the system to restrict 
functionalities based on user type (e.g., Admin vs User). 
5. Session Management & Activity Logging 
5.1. Users shall be automatically logged out after a period of inactivity. 
5.2. The system shall maintain logs of login attempts, email activities, and security incidents. 
3. Non-Functional Requirements 
Encryption Compliance 
All email content and stored data shall be encrypted using AES-256 to maintain 
confidentiality. 
Authentication Strength 
The system shall enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication to 
prevent unauthorized access. 
Access Control Mechanism 
Role-based access permissions shall ensure separation of duties and data protection (e.g., 
admins cannot view encrypted emails). 
System Scalability 
The system shall support a large number of concurrent users without performance 
degradation. 
System Reliability 
The application shall ensure high availability and reliability to avoid service disruption during 
critical communications. 
Usability 
The system interface shall be intuitive and easy to use for composing and accessing 
encrypted communications.
